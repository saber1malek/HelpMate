# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis allows HelpMate to identify customer sentiment toward products and sellers  in comments and reviews.
Sentiment analysis is a text analysis method that detects polarity (e.g. a positive or negative opinion) within text, whether a whole document, paragraph, sentence, or clause.

Understanding peopleâ€™s emotions is essential for HelpMate since customers are able to express their thoughts and feelings more openly. By automatically analyzing customer reviews and comments,HelpMate is able to listen attentively to their customers, and tailor products and services to meet their needs.

For example, using sentiment analysis to automatically analyze 4,000+ reviews about our products could help us discover if customers are happy about your pricing plans and customer service.
