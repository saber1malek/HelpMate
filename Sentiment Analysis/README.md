# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis allows businesses to identify customer sentiment toward products, brands or services in online conversations and reviews.
Sentiment analysis is a text analysis method that detects polarity (e.g. a positive or negative opinion) within text, whether a whole document, paragraph, sentence, or clause.

Understanding people’s emotions is essential for businesses since customers are able to express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before. By automatically analyzing customer feedback, from survey responses to social media conversations, brands are able to listen attentively to their customers, and tailor products and services to meet their needs.

For example, using sentiment analysis to automatically analyze 4,000+ reviews about your product could help you discover if customers are happy about your pricing plans and customer service.
Types of Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis models focus on polarity (positive, negative, neutral) but also on feelings and emotions (angry, happy, sad, etc), and even on intentions (e.g. interested v. not interested).

Here are some of the most popular types of sentiment analysis:

Fine-grained Sentiment Analysis

If polarity precision is important to your business, you might consider expanding your polarity categories to include:

Very positive
Positive
Neutral
Negative
Very negative
This is usually referred to as fine-grained sentiment analysis, and could be used to interpret 5-star ratings in a review, for example:

Very Positive = 5 stars
Very Negative = 1 star
Emotion detection

This type of sentiment analysis aims at detecting emotions, like happiness, frustration, anger, sadness, and so on. Many emotion detection systems use lexicons (i.e. lists of words and the emotions they convey) or complex machine learning algorithms.

One of the downsides of using lexicons is that people express emotions in different ways. Some words that typically express anger, like bad or kill (e.g. your product is so bad or your customer support is killing me) might also express happiness (e.g. this is bad ass or you are killing it).

Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis

Usually, when analyzing sentiments of texts, let’s say product reviews, you’ll want to know which particular aspects or features people are mentioning in a positive, neutral, or negative way. That's where aspect-based sentiment analysis can help, for example in this text: "The battery life of this camera is too short", an aspect-based classifier would be able to determine that the sentence expresses a negative opinion about the feature battery life.

Multilingual sentiment analysis

Multilingual sentiment analysis can be difficult. It involves a lot of preprocessing and resources. Most of these resources are available online (e.g. sentiment lexicons), while others need to be created (e.g. translated corpora or noise detection algorithms), but you’ll need to know how to code to use them.

Alternatively, you could detect language in texts automatically with MonkeyLearn’s language classifier, then train a custom sentiment analysis model to classify texts in the language of your choice. Sign up for free to try this model out.

Why Perform Sentiment Analysis?

It’s estimated that 80% of the world’s data is unstructured, in other words it’s unorganized. Huge volumes of text data (emails, support tickets, chats, social media conversations, surveys, articles, documents, etc), is created every day but it’s hard to analyze, understand, and sort through, not to mention time-consuming and expensive.

Sentiment analysis, however, helps businesses make sense of all this unstructured text by automatically tagging it.

Benefits of sentiment analysis include:

Sorting Data at Scale Can you imagine manually sorting through thousands of tweets, customer support conversations, or surveys? There’s just too much data to process manually. Sentiment analysis helps businesses process huge amounts of data in an efficient and cost-effective way.
Real-Time Analysis Sentiment analysis can identify critical issues in real-time, for example is a PR crisis on social media escalating? Is an angry customer about to churn? Sentiment analysis models can help you immediately identify these kinds of situations and gauge brand sentiment, so you can take action right away.
Consistent criteria It’s estimated that people only agree around 60-65% of the time when determining the sentiment of a particular text. Tagging text by sentiment is highly subjective, influenced by personal experiences, thoughts, and beliefs. By using a centralized sentiment analysis system, companies can apply the same criteria to all of their data, helping them improve accuracy and gain better insights.
