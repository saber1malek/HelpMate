# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis allows businesses to identify customer sentiment toward products, brands or services in online conversations and reviews.
Sentiment analysis is a text analysis method that detects polarity (e.g. a positive or negative opinion) within text, whether a whole document, paragraph, sentence, or clause.

Understanding peopleâ€™s emotions is essential for businesses since customers are able to express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before. By automatically analyzing customer feedback, from survey responses to social media conversations, brands are able to listen attentively to their customers, and tailor products and services to meet their needs.

For example, using sentiment analysis to automatically analyze 4,000+ reviews about your product could help you discover if customers are happy about your pricing plans and customer service.
Types of Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis models focus on polarity (positive, negative, neutral) but also on feelings and emotions (angry, happy, sad, etc), and even on intentions (e.g. interested v. not interested).

Here are some of the most popular types of sentiment analysis:

Very Positive = 5 stars
